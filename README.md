# ðŸš€ Azure DevOps Interview Questions and Answers (50 QA)

## Basics â€“ Azure DevOps Overview
1. **What is Azure DevOps?**
   > Azure DevOps is a cloud platform from Microsoft that provides DevOps capabilities like CI/CD pipelines, project management, repository hosting (Git), and artifact storage.

2. **What services are available in Azure DevOps?**
   > Azure Boards, Azure Repos, Azure Pipelines, Azure Test Plans, Azure Artifacts.

3. **Difference between Azure DevOps Services and Azure DevOps Server?**
   > *Services* = cloud-based SaaS; *Server* = on-premises version (formerly TFS).

4. **What is CI/CD?**
   > Continuous Integration (automatically building/testing code) and Continuous Delivery/Deployment (automatically releasing changes to production).

5. **What are pipelines in Azure DevOps?**
   > Pipelines automate the build, test, and deployment of applications.

## Git, Repos & Version Control
6. **What is Azure Repos?**
   > Azure Repos provides Git repositories or Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) for source control.

7. **Explain branching strategies in Git.**
   > Feature branching, Gitflow, Trunk-based development, Release branching.

8. **What is a pull request in Azure Repos?**
   > A pull request is a way to propose changes into a repository, with review before merging.

9. **How to trigger a build on a pull request?**
   > Enable *Build Validation* policies on the branch.

10. **What are Git Hooks?**
    > Scripts that run automatically on specific Git events (e.g., commit, push).

---

## Azure Pipelines
11. **What types of pipelines exist?**
    > YAML pipelines (code as configuration) and Classic pipelines (UI-based).

12. **What is a build pipeline?**
    > Automates compiling code, running tests, and producing artifacts.

13. **What is a release pipeline?**
    > Automates deployment to environments like dev, test, staging, production.

14. **What is an artifact in Azure DevOps?**
    > A file or set of files produced during a build (like compiled binaries, packages).

15. **What is a pipeline agent?**
    > A computing infrastructure where your pipeline runs, can be Microsoft-hosted or self-hosted.

---

## YAML Pipelines
16. **What are key elements in a YAML pipeline?**
    > `trigger`, `pool`, `steps`, `jobs`, `stages`, `variables`.

17. **How to define variables in YAML?**
    ```yaml
    variables:
      buildConfiguration: 'Release'
    ```

18. **How can you create pipeline templates?**
    > By creating reusable YAML templates that can be referenced in multiple pipelines.

19. **What is multi-stage pipeline?**
    > Defines multiple stages like Build, Test, and Deploy in a single YAML file.

20. **How to secure secrets in YAML pipelines?**
    > Use Azure Key Vault integration or pipeline secret variables.

---

## Deployment Strategies
21. **What is blue-green deployment?**
    > Running two identical production environments (Blue and Green), switching traffic after testing new deployment.

22. **What is canary deployment?**
    > Gradually rolling out changes to a small subset of users before full rollout.

23. **What is rolling deployment?**
    > Gradual deployment across servers in batches to avoid downtime.

24. **Difference between deployment group and environment in Azure DevOps?**
    > Deployment group = set of on-prem servers; Environment = logical boundary for deployments (cloud and hybrid).

25. **How to rollback in Azure Pipelines?**
    > Re-deploy a previous stable build or automate rollback steps in pipeline.

---

## Azure Boards (Project Management)
26. **What is Azure Boards?**
    > It helps manage work with Kanban boards, backlogs, and sprints.

27. **What are work items?**
    > Tasks, bugs, features, user stories tracked in a project.

28. **Explain the Scrum process in Azure Boards.**
    > Azure Boards support Scrum practices with Sprint Planning, Task Boards, Burndown charts.

29. **What is a backlog?**
    > A prioritized list of work items or features.

30. **What is a sprint?**
    > A fixed-length event where a team commits to delivering a set of items from the backlog.

---

## Azure Test Plans
31. **What is Azure Test Plans?**
    > It provides manual and exploratory testing capabilities.

32. **What is exploratory testing?**
    > Unscripted, free-form testing based on experience and intuition.

33. **How can you integrate automated tests in pipeline?**
    > Use tasks to run unit tests, Selenium tests, etc., and publish test results.

34. **What is load testing?**
    > Testing the system's behavior under heavy load (Azure Load Testing).

35. **How are bugs managed in Azure Test Plans?**
    > Directly log bugs during manual or exploratory testing with rich data capture.

---

## Azure Artifacts
36. **What is Azure Artifacts?**
    > A repository service for managing NuGet, npm, Maven, Python, or Universal packages.

37. **Difference between feed and package?**
    > *Feed* = container for packages; *Package* = versioned artifact like a library or module.

38. **How to publish artifacts from build pipeline?**
    > Use `PublishPipelineArtifact` or `PublishBuildArtifact` tasks.

39. **Why use Azure Artifacts over GitHub Packages?**
    > Tighter Azure integration, organizational feeds, more enterprise features.

40. **What is upstream source?**
    > Connect external package sources to your Azure Artifacts feed (like npmjs.com, Maven Central).

---

## Security and Permissions
41. **How do you manage access in Azure DevOps?**
    > Through users, groups, roles, and policies.

42. **What are service connections?**
